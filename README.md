# Pink Gear English Fan Translation
Work-in-progress english fan translation for PINK GEAR, a point-and-click adventure game by Masami Ishimaru, published by TOSHIBA EMI (1997).


# About
PINK GEAR is made with Macromedia Director 5. This translation works by modifying cast members in protected cast files (.cxt extension) using Director 5. We are replacing cast member images containing Japanese text with edited images with English text. We then replace the original cast member file (.cxt), with our own cast member file (.cst). The game will then play our new cast file. This only works because the cast files in this game simply contain assets and not scripts.
