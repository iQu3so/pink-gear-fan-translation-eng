1. Open Director 5 and go to Modify -> Movie -> Casts
2. Click "Link..." and change the "Files of type" dropdown to "All files"

4. Click OK and click Window -> Cast -> Castname to start editing the cast file.
5. Click Window -> Message to open the Message Window if it's not already open.
6. Find a bitmap cast member that needs to be replaced. Make a note of its name. Type put the regPoint of member "name" into the Message Window and press Enter.
7. Select the cast member and delete it. Click File -> Import and select the bitmap file to replace it.
8. In the Image Options dialog that pops up, choose the palette matching the cast name.
9. Set the cast member's name back to the original name.
10. Copy the registration point that you got in step 6. Set the registration point back to this value by typing this into the Message Window: set the regPoint of member "name" to point(x, y), replacing point(x, y) with the point you copied.
11. When you finish inserting cast members, make sure that the Cast window is selected, then click File -> Save As...
12. Rename the saved .cst file to .cxt, then replace the original cast file in the game's directory. Run the game and check if the translations look good!
