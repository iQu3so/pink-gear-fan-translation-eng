A_IN03C
Cast members 135 - 139 look a bit off center (biased to the right). The original text may have this trait too. Maybe fix in the future.

C2_TWINC - Player name is a bit off. If we develop a method to move text, just move it down slightly. If not, edit regpoint of the member slightly up.

C7_BASEC
Cast member 97 has some clipping with the player name in the score preview of Director MX 

E3_GUITC
Cast members 44, 45, and 61 unnecessarily reference the player name. We had to make modifications to these members to fit the text. We should look into scripting the player name out if possible/necessary. Cast member regpoints were manually modified to better center the images.
The "Obtained Fragment" screen has weird positioning for the player name. If we can reposition the player name, we should align it better to accommodate longer names.

F3_PLAYC
Cast member 42's name clips into the text. There are ongoing efforts to move this player name or sub it in with one that we can manipulate, but this is something we will need to fix before release.

H1_GAMF
Member 135 (the only file being replaced) can't be found in score so we can't test or verify whether it is in-game.
H2_GAMEC
Cannot verify whether some registration points are correct (namely H2_GAMEC.cxt_117, H2_GAMEC.cxt_118, H2_GAMEC.cxt_119, H2_GAMEC.cxt_120, H2_GAMEC.cxt_122). The registration points were previously 0,0 but we changed the size of the images, so we used the formula to calculate the new registration points resulting in a much larger X value.

J4_CARDC.CXT
Member 8 could be better arranged to fit the textbox (see screenshot)
Member 47 could possibly be better arranged to fit the textbox (see screenshot)
Member 75 has some buggy looking text

K5_PIAC.CXT
Cast member 88, 111 elipses are pretty high.. some centering might be required as well.
Other members could use some centering/touch-ups as well.

K6_PIAC.CXT
Dimension changes and references player name.. probably will need to move player name location when we are able to do that.

M4_PIAC.CXT
Dimension changes and references player name.. probably will need to move player name location when we are able to do that.

NA6_BOXC.CXT
Member 71, 73, 74 could use centering..
Member 100 might be messed up because of dimension changes and player name mention.

P2_COWC.CXT
Members 172, 173 are not vertically aligned.
Member 178's player name could be moved down a bit
Member 184's player name could be moved up a bit
Member 185's player name is way off
Member 186's player name is probably way off too (can't see in editor)
Member 196's player name could be moved with a consistent alignment choice once we get there.

Members 188, 189 are essentially the same image whereas the originals are different colors
Members 191, 192 are essentially the same image whereas the originals are different colors.

Q2_PUCST.CXT
Member 53 has a grammatical error. "As for the instructions... Oh hoh, it seems arleady heard them."
Member 113 could be moved ever so slightly to the left.


Q6_PUCST.CXT
Member 43 references player name and has dimension changes. May need to move player name. Maybe just remove player name entirely and redo image.. It sounds pretty weird with it in there. See screenshot.
Member 78 references player name and has dimension changes.. will need to move player name.


U2_DRCT.CXT
Member 108's player name could be moved up a bit. The image could be moved up a bit too.
Member 112's player name could be moved up a bit.


U4_DRC.CXT
Member 66 has dimension changes and player name mention.. will need to move player name a bit.


W4_SAXC.CXT
Member 79's player name could be moved to the right a bit.
Member 83's player name could be moved down-right a bit.
Member 87's player name could be moved down-right a bit.
Member 88's player name could be moved right a tiny bit.
Member 145 has dimension changes and references player name.. name will need to be moved a bit (left)


Z01_LACT.CXT
Member 43 has slight dimension change and mentions player name. Clips with players name a bit. Need to move player name right a bit.


Z01_LCCT.CXT
Member 43 has weird regpoints that don't seem to correspond to the dimensions. It probably also clips badly with the player name so we should just manually set this one.


Z05_LACT.CXT
Member 76, 78, 79 is too big and clips with the scroll arrow. Might need to pack more text or get creative (expand dialog.. move dialog etc. not impossible.) (maybe split our dialog into parts and try to derail the execution to show our parts first)
Member 80 is presumably too big and we will need to expand the dialog box or shorten text.
Member 82 may be too big as well.

Z07_LACT.CXT
Various text centering issues.. maybe some artifacting with the text itself but nothing major.
